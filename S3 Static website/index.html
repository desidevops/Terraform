            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a passionate DevOps Engineer with four years of experience in implementing and managing cloud solutions, specializing in AWS. My expertise lies in designing scalable and reliable cloud architectures, leveraging a wide array of AWS services to drive efficiency and innovation.</p>
            <p>Throughout my career, I have worked in both product-based and service-based companies, gaining valuable experience across multiple industries, including cloud telephony, e-commerce, game development, and textile IT cloud-based services. This diverse background has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of different business needs and technical challenges.</p>
            <p>In the cloud telephony sector, I have designed and managed solutions that integrate with telecommunication systems, ensuring high availability and seamless communication. My experience in e-commerce involved optimizing cloud infrastructure to handle high traffic volumes and ensuring secure transactions. In game development, I’ve worked on building scalable environments to support real-time multiplayer experiences and large-scale game data. In the textile industry, I’ve contributed to developing and maintaining cloud-based systems that enhance operational efficiency and data management.</p>
            <p>My hands-on experience with AWS includes setting up and maintaining EC2 instances, configuring RDS for relational databases, and implementing S3 for scalable storage solutions. I have utilized AWS Lambda for serverless computing and am proficient with AWS CloudFormation and Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC) to automate and streamline deployments.</p>
            <p>I am skilled in optimizing cost management and performance tuning by using AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and AWS Cost Explorer for budgeting. I also ensure robust security practices with AWS IAM, managing access and permissions effectively to protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with industry standards.</p>
            <p>In addition to technical skills, I am dedicated to fostering a culture of continuous improvement and collaboration. I work closely with development teams to integrate CI/CD pipelines using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild, facilitating faster and more reliable software releases.</p>
